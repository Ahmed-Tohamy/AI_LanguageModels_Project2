# AI_LanguageModels_Project2

This project explores the design, training, and evaluation of generative language models using PyTorch. It includes implementations of four neural network architectures:

- Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)
- Transformer

These models were trained on a literary text dataset using subword tokenization with SentencePiece and evaluated both quantitatively (Perplexity, BLEU Score) and qualitatively through prompt-based generation.
